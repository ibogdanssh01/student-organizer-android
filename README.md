# Student Organizer (Android, Java, SQLite)

Student Organizer is a simple Android application designed to help university students manage their academic life in one place. The app allows you to track courses, assignments, and exams, view a weekly schedule, and see useful statistics such as GPA and assignment completion.

The project is built with:

- Java (Android)

- Classic Activities + ListView + custom adapters

It is intentionally kept simple and easy to understand, making it suitable both as a real-life utility and as an academic/demo project.
